[Prior to freezing]{.underline}

Take a few colonies from agar plate and inoculate into \~2ml Bold\'s
liquid (or more, depending on how many replicates you are freezing).
Grow for a few days (usually 3-4) until green growth is visible.

[ ]{.underline}

[Setting up]{.underline}

-   Leave cultures on lab bench (in dim/ambient light) for at least a
    couple of hours before starting the freezing protocol.
-   Make cryopreservation liquid - 10% volume: volume with Bold\'s
    liquid (for example: add 5ml of Methanol to 45ml of Bold\'s in a
    falcon tube).
-   Filter sterilise the cryopreservation liquid using 0.2μm filters
-   Label tubes and add 0.9ml cryopreservation liquid to tubes.
-   Need boxes to hold tubes (cryo boxes of 81 tube capacity).

[ ]{.underline}

[Freezing process (work with lights off in the flow hood)]{.underline}

-   Add 0.9ml of the grown liquid culture to the cryotubes containing
    0.9ml of cryopreservation liquid in low light levels.
-   Vortex, and place cryotube into \'Mr Frosty\' freezing container and
    put container into -80°C freezer for 4 hours.
-   Take tubes out of \'Mr Frosty\' and plunge into liquid nitrogen for
    storage.
-   Note: After every 4 or 5 use of a Mr Frosty, the IPA liquid in the
    Mr Frosty should be changed

[ ]{.underline}

[Thawing and reconditioning frozen stocks]{.underline}

-   Take tubes out of liquid nitrogen.
-   Place tubes in water bath at 35°C for 5 mins. Be wary of lids
    potentially popping off into your face. To avoid this I put the
    cryotube box with lid on into the water bath with tubes inside.
-   Pipette entire contents of tube (1.8ml) into 10ml of Bold\'s liquid
    in a sterile universal and incubate for 4-5 days (or 200uL onto
    agar, or 300uL into 1.7 mL Bold's in 24-well plate).
