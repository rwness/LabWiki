# SALT MA {#TheeffectofsaltstressonMAandadaptation-SALTMA}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Authors: {#TheeffectofsaltstressonMAandadaptation-Authors:}

## Motivation: {#TheeffectofsaltstressonMAandadaptation-Motivation:}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   How does the rate, spectrum and distribution of de novo mutations
    change when subjected to environmental stress.

## Research Questions {#TheeffectofsaltstressonMAandadaptation-ResearchQuestions}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  Does salt stress effect de novo mutation? (Comparison to NonSalt MA)

-   Overall mutation rate (SNM rate, indel rate)
-   base spectrum/context/ indel:SNM ratio

1.  Effect of strain on salt-MA

-   Do strains differ in their salt reaction?
-   Do salt-adapted strains react differently?

1.  Does the distribution of mutations differ between MA, MA-Salt,
    Adaptation

-   Dn:Ds
-   Clustering
-   Network Clustering

```{=html}

```
-   gene enrichments in salt adaptation

## Core Analysis {#TheeffectofsaltstressonMAandadaptation-CoreAnalysis}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

1\. Does salt stress effect de novo mutation? (Comparison to NonSalt MA)

-   Overall mutation rate - 
    -   estimate rate overall 
    -   estimate rate of SaltMA, MA, SaltAdaptation
-   base spectrum/context
    -   estimate and plot 6 mutation rates for MA, saltMA,
        saltAdaptation
    -   estimate and plot 32 triplet rates for MA, saltMA,
        saltAdaptation

1.  Effect of strain on salt-MA \**this line of questioning is likely
    underpowered and if the result is null we should drop it.*
    1.  Do salt-adapted strains have a lower de novo mutation rate in
        salt or a different mutation spectrum in either salt or non-salt
        conditions
    2.  estimate de novo rate of SLs in the two environments compared to
        other lines. 
    3.  Compare the base spectrum of SLs compared to the others in the
        two environments

1.  Does the distribution of mutations differ between MA, MA-Salt,
    Adaptation

-   Dn:Ds
    -   estimate rate of Nonsynonymous vs Synonymous mutations in 3
        groups
-   Clustering
    -   Look at distribution of intermutation distances in three groups
-   Network Clustering
    -   Look at network properties of mutated genes (ie connectivity, 
        betweenness centrality other) - compare among groups and 
        bootstrap
    -   Look at network distance between mutations - compare among
        groups and bootstrap

```{=html}

-   gene enrichments in salt adaptation
    -   I think Josianne already did this

## Task Status {#TheeffectofsaltstressonMAandadaptation-TaskStatus}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   We need to estimate generation time for MA start and end points
