[Protocol A. Maturation in liquid; killing vegetative cells by
freezing]{.underline}

[Protocol B. Maturation on solid agar; killing vegetative cells using
chloroform]{.underline}

[ ]{.underline}

[Protocol A]{.underline}

1.  [Inducing gametogenesis]{.underline}

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
1.  Grow strains in Bold's liquid media until the culture has reached
    high density or carrying capacity.
2.  Centrifuge the cultures at 2,000 x g for 5 minutes. Make sure to
    tape the lid to the plate to prevent spills. 
3.  Remove the supernatant. Add nitrogen-free Bold's liquid media. Mix
    well.
4.  Centrifuge for a second time. Remove supernatant and add
    nitrogen-free media. Only add nitrogen-free media to about half the
    volume of the well. Mix well.
5.  Repeat the washing cycle a third time if you worry that you have not
    been able to remove all of the spent media in the previous two
    washes.
6.  Mix cultures of opposite mating type. Also keep strains unmixed to
    serve as negative controls.
7.  Incubate without shaking, with a clear plastic lid to insure maximum
    lighting, for about 24 hours.

\

[2. Inducing zygote maturation in liquid media]{.underline}

1.  Place the cultures in the dark by wrapping the well plates with
    mated strains and negative controls in aluminum foil.
2.  Leave on lab bench, or in incubator for a minimum of 4 days.

\

[3. Killing unmated cells by freezing]{.underline}

1.  Remove aluminum foil.
2.  Place the well plate in freezer at -20 degrees C until the cultures
    are all fully frozen. This can take about 1-2 hours in a 96-well
    plate that is half-filled.

[4. Germinating zygotes]{.underline}

1.  Remove the well plate from the freezer and let thaw. This takes
    about 30 minutes in a 96-well plate that is half-filled.
2.  Add fresh Bold's media and mix well.
3.  Incubate for at least 2 days. It can be difficult to tell apart dead
    cells from germinated zygotes at the end of this step, so I tend to
    transfer about 5% to fresh media and check after 1 days if there are
    swimming and/or green cells.

[Protocol B]{.underline}

1.  [Inducing gametogenesis]{.underline}

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
1.  Grow strains in Bold's liquid media until the culture has reached
    high density or carrying capacity.
2.  If the cultures are in well plates, exchange the plastic lid for a
    sterile plastic film. Centrifuge the cultures at 2,000 x g for 5
    minutes.
3.  Remove the supernatant. Add nitrogen-free Bold's liquid media. Mix
    well.
4.  Centrifuge for a second time. Remove supernatant and add
    nitrogen-free media. Only add nitrogen-free media to about half the
    volume of the well. Mix well.
5.  Repeat the washing cycle a third time if you worry that you have not
    been able to remove all of the spent media in the previous two
    washes.
6.  Mix cultures of opposite mating type. Also keep strains unmixed to
    serve as negative controls.
7.  Incubate without shaking, with a clear plastic lid to insure maximum
    lighting, for about 24 hours.

[2. Inducing zygote maturation on solid media]{.underline}

1.  Transfer the zygotes to Bold's agar using pipette tips and loops.
    The zygotes are sticky and tend to stick to the pipette tip. So I
    use a loop to rub the zygotes off the tip and onto the agar. It also
    helps to pipette about 50uL of culture on the agar, as the liquid
    helps to disperse the zygotes off the tip and loop. Make sure to
    avoid piercing the agar, as cells can go in the cracks and the
    chloroform vapour will not be able to reach them.
2.  Place the cultures in the dark by wrapping the agar plates with
    mated strains and negative controls in aluminum foil.
3.  Leave on lab bench, or in incubator for a minimum of 4 days.

\

[3. Killing unmated cells using chloroform vapour]{.underline}

1.  Autoclave glass petri dishes.
2.  Add a thin layer of chloroform to the glass petri dish, and cover
    with a glass lid.
3.  Invert the agar plates onto the glass petri dish and cover with the
    glass lid. Leave for 45 seconds.

\

[4. Germinating zygotes]{.underline}

1.  Incubate the agar plates for at least 2 days.
