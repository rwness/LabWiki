Below is a breakdown of how a BIO481 should progress through their
project in my lab. The key thing I want to see is a dedication to the
project and a development of scientific curiosity and rigour. Inherent
throughout the marking is productivity and progress through the project.
The actual scientific result will not directly influence your grade
because reality is not your fault, but I want to see progress which is
why there is an emphasis on notebooks, lab meetings and early writing. 

If you are a normal member of the lab you will get many of these grades
by default. Every responsible scientist keeps a notebook, everyone in
research labs presents their results and the writing and formal
presentations are all part of the requirements for the course. However,
I think the breakdown of marks presented in advance allows you to
structure your schedule. 

## Marking Scheme {#BIO481markingscheme-MarkingScheme}

## Notebook assessed once per term (complete/incomplete) (10%) {#BIO481markingscheme-Notebookassessedonceperterm(complete/incomplete)(10%)}

-   Notebooks should provide an outsider with a detailed account of the
    project

-   It should be at least readable for other lab members and ideally an
    outsider.

-   Dates are absolutely essential information in the lab book

-   More detail is better than less

-   For Bioinformatics and statisical analysis
    -   The notebook should be kept on the server in plain text or
        markdown
    -   The notebook should document all data, scripting and analysis in
        each subfolder 
    -    See "Bioinformatics data skills" by Vince Buffalo for more
        details. 

-        For wet-lab work

-   -   Your lab book is the most important record of your work
    -   Clearly document and organize your progress through the
        experiments 
    -   Digital/paper notebooks or a combination are acceptable. 
    -   samples and material should be labelled to correspond with
        specific notebook entries (I always use my name and the lab book
        date as the key identifier)

## Lab meetings - (complete/incomplete) (5%) {#BIO481markingscheme-Labmeetings-(complete/incomplete)(5%)}

-   present one lab meeting per term
-   attend all lab meetings 
-   Your grade is primarily a participation mark. Lab meetings are
    informal and I want you to know that the quality or quantity of
    slides is less important than our discussion and your progress.
    Although you can get feedback on slides if you wish.

##       Project Proposal (5%) {#BIO481markingscheme-ProjectProposal(5%)}

-   Oral proposal for BIO481 course work
-   1 page summary of questions, data and preliminary methods 
-   Practice talks in lab meetings are mandatory
-   Try to use this to start your introduction/literature review
-   Clearly define questions and propose methods

## Literature Review/ Introduction  {#BIO481markingscheme-LiteratureReview/Introduction}

- Due last day of class 1st term (10%)\
The document will serve as the introduction to your final thesis\
Formatted like the introduction to a scientific article with references
(use style of MBE, Evolution or Genetics)\
Clearly outlining the motivation and background for the research and the
questions to be addressed\
\~5page double spaced 

## Progress & Plans -  Due last day of class 1st term (5%) {#BIO481markingscheme-Progress&Plans-Duelastdayofclass1stterm(5%)}

\
an informal max 1 page report outlining progress and goals for term 2  

## Final Written report last day of second term (40%)  {#BIO481markingscheme-FinalWrittenreportlastdayofsecondterm(40%)}

-   The written report is the single most important component of your
    thesis.
-   It should be written in the style of a scientific paper (Use
    MBE/Genetics/Evolution as a guide)
-   Prior to write up each student should  meet with Rob/other
    collaborators to review results and outline the paper.
-   The length of this document should be about 20 pages double spaced
    (excluding figures/tables/supplemental information). However, it is
    as short or as long as necessary. It would not be unusual to vary
    from 15-30 pages. 
-   It should include:
    -        Title
    -        Abstract 
    -        Introduction
    -        Methods
    -        Results
    -        Discussion
    -        References
    -        Tables/Figures
    -        Supplemental information if necessary

## BIO481 Symposium Oral presentation  (25%) {#BIO481markingscheme-BIO481SymposiumOralpresentation(25%)}

Present 6-8min talk at the BIO481 Symposium and to attend the entire
symposium\
At least 2 days in advanced we will have practice talk for the lab

## Expectations of Students: {#BIO481markingscheme-ExpectationsofStudents:}

Attend lab meetings\
Attend bio seminars\
Work a minimum of 10hrs/week preferably the majority of hours are in the
lab\
Meet regularly with Rob and collaborators\
Meet deadlines\
Keep detailed notes

\

## Expectations of Rob {#BIO481markingscheme-ExpectationsofRob}

Be available for meetings  

Provide help/guidance \
Define questions/methods\
return work quickly and meet deadlines
