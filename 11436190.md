**\*\*CAVEAT\*\* I have just moved these labs from the couse server to
HPCNODE1 the first few people that do these labs will find all kinds of
errors- mostly to do with paths to data and the test cells not working
correctly.  Please tell Rob when you find these errors and he will
correct them and show you how to correct them.**

\

For anyone that wants to do a little self directed learning we are
making available the labs from Rob\'s course BIO362: Bioinformatics. The
labs cover basic Python coding using bioinformatic tools and concepts.
The labs should more or less stand alone and don\'t need any outside
direction. 

To do the labs yourself follow these steps:

##### 1. Log into hpcnode1 using ssh {#BIO362:LearnPythonthroughbioinformatics-1.Logintohpcnode1usingssh}

[See here for instructions:](Connecting-to-the-server_11436068.html)

##### 2. In your bash shell on hpcnode 1 I recommend making a folder for the course  {#BIO362:LearnPythonthroughbioinformatics-2.Inyourbashshellonhpcnode1Irecommendmakingafolderforthecourse}

`mkdir ~/BIO362`

`cd  ~/BIO362`

##### 3. Copy the course to your home folder: {#BIO362:LearnPythonthroughbioinformatics-3.Copythecoursetoyourhomefolder:}

`cp  /scratch/courses/BIO362/BIO362_labs.tgz ./`

##### 4. The file is a compressed tar (tar.gz). Unpack it like this: {#BIO362:LearnPythonthroughbioinformatics-4.Thefileisacompressedtar(tar.gz).Unpackitlikethis:}

`tar -xzvf  BIO362_labs.tgz`

You know should have everything you need to execute the course. [Start
up Jupyter Notebooks on
HPCNODE1](Running-Jupyter-Notebooks-on-the-server_11436072.html) and
navigate to your home directory where your new BIO362 folder is located.
It should look like this:

# The Labs {#BIO362:LearnPythonthroughbioinformatics-TheLabs .p1 style="text-align: left;"}

From Lab1 to Lab7 there are notebooks and data in the respective
folders. For any given Lab you can start the notebook and follow the
instructions to complete the exercises. The exercises all have one cell
in which to write/code your answer. The cell below the answer cell is
the test cell. It has code in it that you should not change. If you have
completed the code properly, you can run the test cell and it will tell
you if your answer is correct or not.
