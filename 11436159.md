| C  | \ | \ | F | Phylogenetic comparisons of this strain and other C. |
| C- | + |   | l | reinhardtii isolates have been made by Liss, Kirk,   |
| 23 |   |   | o | Beyser and Fabry, using introns in the Actin and Ypt |
| 43 |   |   | r | 4 genes. See GenBank sequences U55889, U55890, and   |
|    |   |   | i | U70561. This strain can grow on nitrate. Note: a     |
|    |   |   | d | very old typographical error was discovered in April |
|    |   |   | a | 2008. This strain is actually #224, not #124         |
+----+---+---+---+------------------------------------------------------+
| C  | \ | S | M | This is the type strain for C. smithii as described  |
| C- | + | o | a | by Hoshaw and Ettl, who reviewed the remains of G.M. |
| 13 |   | u | s | Smith's collection after his death. It was           |
| 73 |   | t | s | designated 136f by Smith, and came from a sample     |
|    |   | h | a | collected in 1945 in South Deerfield, Massachusetts. |
|    |   | D | c | Smith had paired this with another strain from       |
|    |   | e | h | California (formerly CC-1372, which is no longer in  |
|    |   | e | u | the Chlamydomonas Resource Center collection), and   |
|    |   | r | s | had identified both as C. reinhardtii. Hoshaw and    |
|    |   | f | e | Ettl concluded that these strains differed           |
|    |   | i | t | sufficiently from the laboratory strain of C.        |
|    |   | e | t | reinhardtii on morphological criteria to warrant     |
|    |   | l | s | description as a new species. Subsequent work has    |
|    |   | d |   | shown that CC-1373 is fully fertile with C.          |
|    |   |   |   | reinhardtii, but has significant sequence            |
|    |   |   |   | polymorphisms in nuclear, chloroplast and            |
|    |   |   |   | mitochondrial DNA. CC-1372 on the other hand appears |
|    |   |   |   | to be an unrelated homothallic strain, probably C.   |
|    |   |   |   | culleus.This strain can grow on nitrate. We          |
|    |   |   |   | recommend CC-1373 as a polymorphic strain for        |
|    |   |   |   | comparison with C. reinhardtii. Its one drawback is  |
|    |   |   |   | that it sometimes forms "clumpy" cultures as a       |
|    |   |   |   | result of failure of the mother cell walls to lyse   |
|    |   |   |   | after vegetative division. This property may result  |
|    |   |   |   | in poor mating efficiency. In our experience,        |
|    |   |   |   | letting the gamete mixture sit for 24 hours or more  |
|    |   |   |   | usually produces enough release of autolysin to      |
|    |   |   |   | overcome the hatching defect.                        |
+----+---+---+---+------------------------------------------------------+
| C  | \ | A | M | This is Sager's basic wild type strain. It has the   |
| C- | + | m | a | wild type alleles at the NIT1 and NIT2 loci, and     |
| 16 |   | h | s | should be green in the dark. Sager's original        |
| 90 |   | e | s | publication called it 21gr, but 21 gr has become the |
|    |   | r | a | more prevalent usage over the years.                 |
|    |   | s | c |                                                      |
|    |   | t | h | This strain was the source for most of the cDNA      |
|    |   |   | u | libraries, and subsequent EST sequences, in the      |
|    |   |   | s | Chlamydomonas Genome Project, and is our recommended |
|    |   |   | e | choice for a wild type strain that grows on nitrate  |
|    |   |   | t |                                                      |

| CC | \ | A | M | This is a mt- equivalent to Sager's basic wild type  |
| -1 | - | m | a | strain (see CC-1690). It has the wild type alleles   |
| 69 |   | h | s | at the NIT1 and NIT2 loci and can grow on            |
| 1  |   | e | s | nitrate.The original 6145c was selected as a strain  |
|    |   | r | a | that is yellow in the dark, carrying what was later  |
|    |   | s | c | described as the y1 mutant (see CC-735). This        |
|    |   | t | h | particular isolate has been grown in constant light  |
|    |   |   | u | for years and is probably mixed for y1 and its wild  |
|    |   |   | s | type allele.                                         |

| CC | \ | \ | M | This strain, S1 D2, and S1 C5 (CC-2290) are very     |
| -1 | - |   | i | similar wild Chlamy isolates from Minnesota. They    |
| 95 |   |   | n | have extensive sequence polymorphisms with the lab   |
| 2  |   |   | n | strain of C. reinhardtii, but are fully interfertile |
|    |   |   | e | with it. Crosses between the lab strain and these    |
