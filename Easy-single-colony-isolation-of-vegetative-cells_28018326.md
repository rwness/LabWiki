*Fool-proof and you get lots of single colonies. *

## Procedure: {#Easysinglecolonyisolationofvegetativecells-Procedure:}

1.  Inoculate strain of interest from working slant to 200 uL TAP in 96
    well plate using an inoculating loop.
2.  Incubate under light (25C, 100 rpm) for 2 days.
3.  Before the dilution, mix the culture well with a pipette. 
4.  Dilute the strain by adding 10 uL culture from 96 well plate to 990
    uL TAP in a new plate. 
5.  Transfer 10 uL from the diluted culture to to the center of a 1.5%
    agar in TAP plate. 
6.  Spread the inoculum evenly following the general pattern below.
    Start with several horizontal streaks in the middle (dark blue),
    followed by slightly lighter blue streaks, and finish with the
    lightest blue streaks. \

7.  Incubate under light (25C, any rpm) for 4-5 days until you have the
    ideal single colony sizes. You should end up with at least some
    single colonies near the edges of the agar plate.
8.  Seal the plate with Parafilm. Use within one month. Some strains
    don\'t do well after one month in a sealed agar plates (most notably
    GB-117).
