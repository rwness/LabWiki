A lot of the computation research in the Ness lab is done on our Lab's
high performance computer. This computer is housed in the I ITS data
centre. To access it we use a variety of methods. The most common ways
are using SSH or FTP

\## \`ssh\`\
\-\--\
\`ssh\` stands for Secure SHell - it is a way of logging into a remote
computer from the command line. It will make a BASH shell that is
running on the server rather than your own computer. Once you've logged
in you will be able to work on the server as if you're on your own
computer.

To connect to a remote computer you need to open a new shell on your own
computer (Mac or Linux). Then you type:

ssh
[utorid@hpcnode1.utm.utoronto.ca](mailto:utorid@hpcnode1.utm.utoronto.ca){.external-link
rel="nofollow"}

Obviously replace \`utorid\` with your own utorid. It will prompt you
for your password. There are ways of logging in without typing your
password every time, but you can google that on our own if you want.

If you are on Windows there is no terminal/shell built in, so there are
a number of programs dedicated to SSH from Windows to Mac/Linux
computers.

\## FTP\
\-\--

FTP (and SFTP) are methods for transferring files from one computer to
another. You will most commonly use FTP programs to do these operations
(although you can use it in a web browser or command line). Some common
FTP clients for Mac are:

\- Transmit\
- Filezilla\
- Cyberduck

One convenience is that these programs will allow you to edit text files
on the server within your local text editor (on your own computer) and
the changes are automatically saved on the server.

\## \`scp\`\
scp or secure copy is a command-line based method for copying files over
the network - in other words it lets you transfer files from one
computer to another

e.g.\
copy file from the server to your computer:

scp
[utorid@hpcnode1.utm.utoronto.ca](mailto:utorid@hpcnode1.utm.utoronto.ca){.external-link
rel="nofollow"}:/path/to/my/file /where/you/want/the/file

copy your file to the server

scp /where/you/want/the/file
[utorid@hpcnode1.utm.utoronto.ca](mailto:utorid@hpcnode1.utm.utoronto.ca){.external-link
rel="nofollow"}:/path/to/my/file

##tmux\
\-\--\
\`tmux\` is a command-line tool that allows your command-line sessions
to persist even after you disconnect from the server. There are many
conveniences of tmux, but primarily it means that if you lose your
connection to the server, your work will not be affected.

I do all my commandline work on the server through tmux and I highly
recommend you do the same

Here is a tmux
\[tutorial\]([https://danielmiessler.com/study/tmux/](https://danielmiessler.com/study/tmux/){.external-link

rel="nofollow"})

\## UTORVPN\
\-\--\
To connect to the server in anyway you need to be logged into the
University's VPN. It's more or less routes all your internet traffic
through the university and provides an extra layer of security for our
computer. Only graduate students and staff have access by default so
undergrads will need to request an account through Rob Ness.\
