[Here are a couple of general rules to follow when purchasing materials
for the lab.]{style="color: rgb(0,51,102);"}

1.  Search for your product on MedStore and different suppliers on
    USource before you make your order. Sometimes you can find that
    different suppliers carry a product with the quality and
    specifications you need but at different prices. Get the one that
    costs less.
2.  If you are ordering a new product and the price is more than a
    couple hundred dollars, get Rob\'s approval before you place your
    order. If it is less than a couple hundred dollars and/or is a
    product we regularly purchase, just go ahead and make the order.Â

[[USource]{style="color: rgb(0,51,102);"}]{.underline}

[[\
]{style="color: rgb(0,51,102);"}]{.underline}[In USource you can order
from Fisher Scientific, Sigma, VWR, Grand & Toy, and lots of other
suppliers. To access USource you need your UTORID and an account.
Contact Rob Ness to setup your account.]{style="color: rgb(0,51,102);"}

[[MedStore]{style="color: rgb(0,51,102);"}]{.underline}

[[\
]{style="color: rgb(0,51,102);"}]{.underline}[The University of Toronto
MedStore carries all the common laboratory materials at discounted
prices. There is a \$5 delivery fee to ship from downtown, so try to
order everything you need from MedStore in one order instead of multiple
separate orders.]{style="color: rgb(0,51,102);"}

The Ness lab has an account with MedStore, with user name NessLab.
Contact Rob Ness or Josianne to get the password.

[Beckman Coulter]{.underline}

The supplies for the Quanta Flow cytometer in Steven Short\'s lab come
from Beckman Coulter. The responsibility of purchasing supplies for the
flow cytometer is shared among the users of the flow cytometer. If you
have been using it significantly, you need to contribute to the
purchasing of supplies.

The Ness lab has an account with Beckman Coulter, with user name
rnesslab. Contact Rob Ness or Josianne to get the password.

[DV Stores]{.underline}

[\
]{.underline}DV Stores carries some of the common laboratory supplies.
If there is something you need and they don\'t carry it, they can order
it for you. They are located in the basement of the William G. Davis
building. Mention you are from the Ness lab.

[Other sources]{.underline}

[\
]{.underline}If you want to order from a different source, e.g. Amazon,
you can use the lab credit card to make the transaction. Ask Rob for the
credit card details.
