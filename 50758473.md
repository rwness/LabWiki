**Prep Homigenization Solution** (Note: This mixed solution ONLY lasts
for 30 days, so ensure you make just enough) 

-   Add 20 ul of refrigerated 1-Thioglycerol to 1 mL of Homogenization
    Solution

**Prep DNase I**

-   Add 275 uL of Nuclease-free water to the entire vial of lyophilized
    DNase I (Mix well) 
-   Add 5 uL of Blue Dye to mixture 

**Procedure**

1.  Prep your homogenization solution and ensure it has been placed on
    ice for at least 30 minutes
2.  Store the TissueLyser pods at -80\*C fridge for minimum 30 minutes 
3.  Label 2 mL Erlenmeyer tubes per sample and place in TissueLyser
    pods 
4.  Add 200 ul of homogenization solution into each sample
5.  Shake your mixture at 25 shakes/s for 30 seconds 
6.  Quickly place samples on ice 
7.  Add 200 ul of Lysis buffer per tube on ice 
8.  Immediately vortex at high for 15-30 sec (until the pellet is fully
    broken) 
9.  Incubate all samples at room temperature for 15 minutes 
10. Centrifuge at 16 K CFU for 2 mins 
11. Pour supernatant in well#1
12. Add 5 uL of prepared DNase I to well #4 (It should turn green over
    time if done correctly)
13. Add 50 uL of nuclease-free water to the elution tube 
14. Add plunger and run on Maxwell RSC Instrument 
15. If your run is aborted, follow instructions by the machine
