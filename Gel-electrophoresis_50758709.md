This specific method of electrophoresis was taught to me by grad
students in Adriano Senatore\'s lab. The rigs/power packs in the lab are
shared with Adriano, so treat the equipment with care.

Additionally, some electrophoresis etiquette tips from Adriano:

-   Please ensure that you empty and rinse rigs after use.
-   Some of the gel casting trays are starting to crack. This is caused
    by pouring hot molten agarose solution into the trays without
    cooling. Please cool your molten agarose solutions prior to pouring
    into the trays.
-   Please also clean up the area after use, including wiping down the
    counter and rinsing your flasks containing residual agarose and
    ethidium bromide.
-   Please ensure that you turn off the power packs after use.

# Making the gel {#Gelelectrophoresis-Makingthegel}

## Protocol {#Gelelectrophoresis-Protocol}

1.  Prep TAE 1x if needed.
    -   stock TAE is 50x
    -   add 20 mL 50x TAE to 980 mL MilliQ to create 1 L 1x TAE
2.  Mix agarose and TAE 1x in an EtBr designated flask to create gel
    solution. Swirl flask.\
    -   1.5% agarose - 2.25 g in 150 mL TAE 1x
    -   3% agarose for longer runs (e.g. when imaging shorter
        fragments) - 4.5 g in 150 mL TAE 1x
3.  Microwave flask for 1 minute and 30 seconds uncovered. Watch flask -
    as soon as flask starts bubbling over with rising foam, stop
    microwave (though 1.5 min is usually just enough for 3% gels). If
    solution is not clear, microwave again for a shorter period of
    time - once solution is clear, it\'s ready.
    -   *Make sure to use thermal gloves to handle flask from here*.
        It\'s going to be burning hot to the touch.
4.   Let solution cool.\
    -   Either leave flask at room temp for \~15 minutes, or run side of
        flask under cold water. I like to periodically (and very
        carefully) check the heat of the flask against the side of my
        arm until I can hold it there for several seconds.
    -   Careful to avoid letting the solution cool so much it starts
        solidifying. Pouring too late will make for an uneven gel that
        will image very poorly, while pouring too early (with the
        solution still too hot) will cause the gel cast to warp.
5.  While the solution is cooling - in gel rig, lift gel cassette and
    stick it back in rotated 90 degrees. This creates a seal and leaves
    out the remaining buffer. Make sure the seal is tight. Add gel
    comb(s) as needed and use pipette tips to seal them in place if
    needed.
6.  Once solution is cool, add \~7-8 uL EtBr directly into the solution.
    Swirl the flask to mix until EtBr has dissolved.
    -   *Directly* into the solution. Make sure the tip is immersed.
7.  Carefully pour gel solution into cassette. Pop/redirect any bubbles
    with a stray tip. Let dry + solidify for 15-20 minutes.
    -   *Immediately* fill out the flask with water completely and leave
        in sink. We\'ll come back to this.
    -   I usually use this downtime to refill tips as needed and/or add
        loading dye to my samples (see below).
8.  When the gel has solidified, remove gel comb. The gel will turn
    increasingly translucent as it dries; when it looks uniformly
    translucent, it\'s ready. Careful to grab the sides of the comb and
    pull *directly* upwards - do not jiggle it from side to side.  Lift
    gel cassette + gel back out of the rig and place back in with the
    correct orientation. The gel should be submerged in buffer - add
    more 1x TAE if needed.

## Materials {#Gelelectrophoresis-Materials}

-   agarose (vol. depends on gel size)
-   1x TAE (vol. depends on gel size)
-   EtBr
-   flask (designated for EtBr usage)
-   p10 pipette
-   microwave

# Loading and running the gel {#Gelelectrophoresis-Loadingandrunningthegel}

## Protocol {#Gelelectrophoresis-Protocol.1}

1.  Make sure gel is submerged in 1x TAE buffer.
2.  Use parafilm technique to mix DNA ladder with loading dye. Carefully
    load DNA ladder into wells as needed.
3.  If samples aren\'t already mixed with loading dye, use parafilm
    technique to mix and load samples on a sample-by-sample basis. Add
    8-10 uL sample (vol. includes loading dye) per well.
    -   If I\'m not going to use the PCR product for anything besides
        the gel, I usually just add loading dye directly to the PCR
        product itself. I add 4 uL 6x loading dye added to 20 uL PCR
        product and mix. This can be sped up quite a bit with
        multichannel pipettes. This is very useful for quick assays.
4.  Add \~5-7 uL EtBr to buffer in gel rig directly **below** the gel.
    Swirl left and right with pipette tip to dissolve EtBr.
5.  Add \~5-7 uL EtBr to buffer in gel rig directly **above** the gel.
    Swirl left and right with pipette tip to dissolve EtBr.
    1.  I\'ve been separately told that this addition above the gel
        doesn\'t make a huge difference, but I still tend to do it.
6.  Connect gel power supply to rig. *Make sure electrodes are in the
    right orientation*.
7.  Run gel at required voltage. As soon as the power supply is turned
    on, look at the top end of the gel rig --- there should be a
    \'burst\' of evenly spaced bubbles coming out of the top edge, and
    not the bottom. If not, your elctrodes are reversed.
    -   4V/cm (ie 80-100 V) for 1-1.5 hours is usually a good balance
        for most purposes.
    -   For smaller DNA products, use lower voltages and run for longer.
        I run 3% gels at 65-70 V for 3 hours to image bands that are
        \~100 bp in size and have \~15 bp size differences between them.
8.  Remember that flask we heated the agarose in and filled up with
    water? Rinse it out a few times and leave it up to dry.

# Imaging the gel {#Gelelectrophoresis-Imagingthegel}

## Protocol {#Gelelectrophoresis-Protocol.2}

1.  Make sure you\'ve booked the GelDoc on the 3rd floor in advance.
    You\'ll need no more than the base 15 minute slot.
2.  Stop gel power supply, turn it off, and remove electrodes.
3.  Remove gel cassette and gently place gel on styrofoam (or other)
    tray.
    -   I usually put a few napkins on the tray first to absorb all the
        liquid coming out.
4.  Cover gel with napkins and take over to the gel imager (3rd floor
    core facility)
5.  Place the gel inside the imager. Imaging software should be open on
    the computer already. Select New Protocol → Nucleic Acid → EtBr.
    1.  I usually disable the \'highlight saturated pixels\' option,
        which is on by default for some reason.
6.  Use the software to help position the gel. The position gel will
    turn on a standard (non-UV) light, so you can keep the door open and
    reposition the gel. There are grid lines in the preview to help you
    line up the gel as well.
7.  Close the imager door and scan the gel.
8.  Celebrate/panic/grieve/mourn after looking at the results.
9.  Save image to the lab folder - make sure to use an informative file
    name that has the date at minimum. Print to the Mitsubishi printer
    if desired.
10. Take the gel back out. Make sure to clean the inside of the imager.
11. Bring the gel and tray back downstairs. Dispose of the gel, your
    gloves, and napkins in a specially marked EtBr waste bucket.
