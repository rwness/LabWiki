# MA Expression {#MAExpression-MAExpression}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Authors: {#MAExpression-Authors:}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    - Eni Balogun
    - Peter/Nick??
    - Rob Ness

## Motivation {#MAExpression-Motivation}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    - How does de novo mutation influence changes in gene expression

## Research Questions {#MAExpression-ResearchQuestions}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    1. What is the effect of de novo mutation in overall variation in gene expression?
        - Does expression diverge up and down at same rate
        - What is the per mutation change in gene expression

    2. How do locations of mutations co-localize with expression changes
        - Is there evidence of cis- vs trans-regulatory changes? 

    3. Does change in expression differ based on gene properties
        - Does expression change correlate with evolutionary constraint
        - Do expression changes correlate with expression level
        - Do expression changes differ by in network properties
        - Do expression changes cluster in network sections

## Core Analysis {#MAExpression-CoreAnalysis}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    1. What is the effect of de novo mutation in overall variation in gene expression?
        - Does expression diverge up and down at same rate
            Calculate fold-change of each gene in each line relative to ancestor
            Calculate mean/median/deviation of up-regulated and down-regulated genes
        - What is the per mutation change in gene expression
            calculate absolute fold change per line
            calculate fold change per mutation (abs(sum of fold_change_line)/number_mutations)
            calculate fold change per generation using per mutation and mutation rate

    2. How do locations of mutations co-localize with expression changes
        - Is there evidence of cis- vs trans-regulatory changes? 
             - Calculate distance to nearest mutation for each gene that is differentially expressed
             - Compare fold change of genes with mutations within N-bp of gene to other genes

    3. Does change in expression differ based on gene properties
        - Does expression change correlate with evolutionary constraint
            - for each gene calculate Dn:Ds (Rob has this)
            - correlate expression change with Dn:Ds (non-synonymous sub rates/synonymous sub rates)
    * Learn more about Dn:Ds
        - Do expression changes correlate with expression level
            - Do high expression genes have their expression more constrained (Compare the Vm of high/low expressed genes)
            - Does the proportional expression change correlate with expression level
        - Do expression changes differ by in network properties (topGO)
           - Do hub or other central genes have different expression change patterns
           - Calculate various network properties for each gene across expression and metabolic networks
           - Calculate correlations of fold change with network properties
        - Do expression changes cluster in network sections
           - read about statistic clustering of genes in network
